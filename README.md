Openfire Admin Web Interface Password Guessing python3 script

 Developed for OpenFire 4.1.3
 
 After 11 failed passwords on an account no one can login from the source IP or any other IP for 10 minutes
     for that account. Also from that source IP no one can not login to any other accounts.
     Unfortunately this is only 66 guesses per hour.
